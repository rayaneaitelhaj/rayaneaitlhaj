####blockquote
I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

####Caret character
>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

####other element inside a blockquote
>He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words:_ VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

####unordered list
* Flour
* Cheese
* Tomatoes

####Ordered list
1. Cut the cheese
2. Slice the tomatoes
3. Rub the tomatoes in flour

####Italics inside a list
* Azalea (_Ericaceae Rhododendron_)

 ####Indentation
 1. Cut the cheese
  
     Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes
   
    Be careful when holding the knife.
  
 For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.

 ####Paragraping with soft break

 We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.

 ####SUB Paragraping with soft break

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

##Exercise 2

####Markdown Extra

>_**Markdown Extra** is an extension to PHP Markdown implementing some features currently not available with the plain Markdown syntax. Markdown Extra is available as a separate parser class in [PHP Markdown Lib](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/).

####Github flavoured markdown

>_GitHub had been using its own variant of Markdown since as early as 2009, adding support for additional formatting such as tables and nesting [block content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element#Block_elements) inside list elements, as well as GitHub-specific features such as auto-linking references to commits, issues, usernames, etc. In 2017, GitHub released a formal specification of its GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) that is based on CommonMark. It is a [strict superset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) of CommonMark, following its specification exactly except for **tables, strikethrough, autolinks and task lists**, which GFM adds as extensions. GitHub also changed the parser used on their sites accordingly, which required that some documents be changed. For instance, GFM now requires that the [hash symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign) that creates a heading be separated from the heading text by a space character_.
